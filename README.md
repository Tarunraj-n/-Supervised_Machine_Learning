Regression is a type of supervised learning in machine learning that deals with predicting a continuous outcome or numerical value based on one or more input features.  
In regression, the goal is to learn a mapping function from the input features to a continuous target variable. 
The output is a real number, and the task is essentially to fit a curve to the data.
Key Concepts:

>Target Variable (Dependent Variable):
The variable you are trying to predict is called the target variable. It's the continuous outcome that you want the model to estimate.

>Features (Independent Variables):
Features are the input variables that the model uses to make predictions. These can be one or more variables that influence the target variable.

>Training Data:
The dataset used to train the regression model. It consists of examples where you know both the input features and the corresponding target values.

>Regression Model:
The algorithm or mathematical function used to learn the relationship between the input features and the target variable. Examples include linear regression, polynomial regression, support vector regression, and more.

>Prediction:
Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. The model takes the input features and provides an estimate of the target variable.


Types of Regression Models:

->Linear Regression:
Assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable. The goal is to find the best-fit line that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the predicted and actual values.

->Polynomial Regression:
Extends linear regression by allowing for higher-degree polynomials. It can capture more complex relationships between features and the target variable.

->Ridge and Lasso Regression:
Introduce regularization to linear regression to prevent overfitting. Ridge regression adds a penalty term to the squared weights, and Lasso regression adds a penalty term to the absolute values of the weights.


->Support Vector Regression (SVR):
Adapts the concepts of support vector machines for regression tasks. It aims to fit as many instances as possible within a specified margin while minimizing deviations from the actual values.

->Decision Tree Regression:
Uses a decision tree to model the relationship between features and the target variable. Each leaf node represents a prediction.

->Random Forest Regression:
An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions, providing a more robust and accurate model.

->Evaluation Metrics:


>Mean Squared Error (MSE):
Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.

>Mean Absolute Error (MAE):
Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.

>R-squared (R²):
Indicates the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is predictable from the independent variables. R² ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit.
